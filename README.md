**Warning:**
Gambling addiction and financial and personal issues might result from playing games like Baccarat_103. Never wager more than you can afford to lose, and never try to make up for lost funds by placing additional bets. It's crucial to take breaks and avoid letting gambling interfere with your regular activities and obligations. Keep in mind that playing this game is purely for fun and not as a means of earning money. Consult a specialist or a support group if you need assistance overcoming a gambling addiction.

**Introduction:**

1. A conventional 52-card deck is used for the game, and two hands are dealt: the player's hand and the banker's hand. You can wager on a tie or either hand winning.

2. To have a hand that is closest to nine is the goal of the game. Aces are represent 1, tens and face cards are worth 0, while all other cards are worth their respective face values.

3. The player and banker both receive two cards at the start of each game. A "natural" is when either hand has a total of 8 or 9 and no further cards are dealt.

4. The player must draw another card if the total of their hands is less than 6. The player stands if their hand total is 6 or 7.

5. If the player opts to stand and their hand total is less than 6, the banker will draw another card. The banker stands if their hand total is 7. If the player's third card is a 6 or 7, and the banker's hand total is 6, the banker draws another card.

6. The hand with the closest sum to 9 is the one that wins. The player wins and is paid even money if their hand is closer to 9. The banker wins and receives even money less a commission if their hand is closer to 9 than any other hand.

7. The player wins and are rewarded 8 to 1 if you bet on a tie and both hands have the same total. This is an uncommon event, so it's not advised to use it as a regular betting strategy.

**Reward:**

If you place a bet and you win, you will receive your initial bet back plus an additional amount equal to 50% of your initial bet. 
For example, if you initially bet $100 and you win, you would receive your $100 bet back plus an additional $50, for a total of $150. Hence, the amount you would receive if you win is equal to your initial bet multiplied by 1.5.
